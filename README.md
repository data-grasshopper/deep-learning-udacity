# Deep Learning @ Udacity
This repository contains the labs from the Deep Learning MOOC @ Udacity

### Lab 1 - NotMNIST
Play with the NotMNIST dataset, which is very similar to the MNIST dataset, but with more real-world characters, hence harder and funnier to play with!

### Lab 2 - Feed Forward Neural Network
Play with Tensorflow to build a feed forward neural network

### Lab 3 - Regularization
Explore different regularization techniques, such as L2 or dropout

### Lab 4 - CNN
Play with Convolutional Neural Networks

### Lab 5 - Word2Vec
Leanr and Play with word embedding with Skip-Gram and CBOW model to embed words into vectors in low dimension space!

### Lab 6 - LSTM
Train a LSTM model!
